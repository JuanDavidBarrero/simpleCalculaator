# Simple Calculator Code with ESP32, Keypad, and I2C LCD

This repository contains code for a basic calculator implementation using an ESP32 microcontroller, a keypad for input, and an I2C LCD for displaying the results.

## Components Used
- ESP32 microcontroller
- 4x4 keypad
- I2C LCD display
- Appropriate wiring connections

## Instructions
1. **Set up your ESP32 development environment** and ensure that you have the required libraries installed for the keypad and I2C LCD.

2. **Connect the components** (ESP32, keypad, and I2C LCD) according to your wiring diagram. Make sure to adjust the pin assignments in the code to match your hardware configuration.

3. **Upload the provided code** to your ESP32 using your preferred development environment.

4. **Open the serial monitor** to view the keypad input and LCD display.

5. **Use the keypad** to enter arithmetic operations and numbers. Press the "=" key to calculate the result, which will be displayed on the LCD.

6. **Enjoy using your simple calculator with ESP32!**
